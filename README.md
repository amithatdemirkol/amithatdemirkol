## About Me  

🚀 **Cyber Security Specialist**  
- Currently working at STM as a Candidate Engineer, focusing on cyber threat analysis, security incident monitoring, and developing Python-based tools for threat intelligence.  
- Experienced in automating workflows and improving detection processes using custom scripts and frameworks.  
- Delivered detailed cyber threat analysis reports to strengthen security postures.

🚀 **Backend Software Developer**  
- Developed and deployed 11 APIs at ASELSAN using modern design patterns, MongoDB, and SQL Server.  
- Delivered API solutions tailored to enterprise-grade projects, enhancing scalability and efficiency.  
- Contributed to the development of tools for subdomain management and email automation at the Ministry of Justice, streamlining operations.

🎓 **Graduation Project: Low-Interaction Modular Honeypot**  
- Designed and developed a modular honeypot system capable of imitating popular network services such as **HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP**, and **Telnet** to bait attackers and gather threat intelligence.  
- Integrated a **protocol tunneling feature**, enabling multiple services to operate on a single port, making it suitable for deployments behind restrictive firewalls.  
- Built a user-friendly Web UI for real-time monitoring and analysis of malicious activities, including IP-based statistics, geolocation insights, and malicious IP lookups.  
- Logged detected attacks into a centralized database, allowing easy expansion of the honeypot's capabilities with additional modules or services.
